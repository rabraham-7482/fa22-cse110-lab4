5. There will be an error since the let keyword was used in the for loop. The let does not allow the scope of the i variable to come down to line 12.

13. Arithmetic
    1.  Output: 32 ; Since the 3 is a string, the + indicated concatenation and so the inteeger 2 is converted to a string and concatenated to '3' to make '32'
    2.  Output: 1 ; Sincee subtraction is used, this displays the difference between 2 numeric values so the string '3' is converted to an integer and the difference beetweeen 3 and 2 is calculated
    3.  3 ; null can becomes the integer 0 during addition arithmetic and so 3 and 0 are added to get 3
    4.  3null ; null becomes 'null' sincee 3 was a string which means the + is concatenation. So, '3' and 'null' are concatenated together to get '3null'
    5.  4 ; true becomes the integer 1 with addition arithmetic and so you add 3 and 1 to get 4
    6.  0 ; false and null both become integer 0 in arithmetic addition so adding 0 and 0 gets you 0
    7.  3undefined ; Since 3 is a string, the + indicates concatenation and undefined is converted to string 'underfined'. So, concatenating '3' and 'undefined' gives you 3undefined
    8.  NaN ; undefined when converted to an integer is NaN and so, the final value is NaN
14. Comparison
    1.  true ; the string 2 is converted to an integer and then when compared wiht the integer 1, 2 is greater than 1 so true is outputted
    2.  false ; since both are strings, the two strings are compared. When looking at the first character of each string '2' is greater than '1' making the entire string '12' less than '2' so false is outputted
    3.  true ; '2' is converteed to the number 2 and so when 2 is compared with 2, they are equal so true is outputted
    4.  false ; this time '2' is not converted to the number 2 and so because the types between the two are different, false is outputted
    5.  false ; true becomes the number 1 when comparing and since this is not equal to 2, false is outputted
    6.  true ; Boolean(2) is true because it is not a value that is intuitively "empty" and so when true is compared with true sincee the types aree also the same, true is outputted
15. == does a type conversion, usually to numbers if the types don't match before assesing equaltiy. On the other hand, === operators does not do a type conversion beefore checking equality. So, if two entries are of differeent types then they are automatically unequal.

17. [2,4,6]; The call to modifyArray() makes the array parameter [1,2,3] and the callback function the doSomething() function which takes in a value and returns the double of that value. So, in the modifyArray() function, a new array called newArr is declared and initialized as empty, then the for loop goes through each element in [1,2,3] and calls the callback function on each element and pushed the output of the callback function to newArr. In the end, newArr consits of values wheere each element from the original array has doubled.
